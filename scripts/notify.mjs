/**
 * Post the run's lane summaries to Discord (webhook in $DISCORD_WEBHOOK).
 * Reads every summary-*.md under the evidence dir (downloaded artifacts).
 * In the workflow each run writes summary-<lane>-<runtime>.md. $LANES (the
 * lanes the run requested, comma-separated) and $RUNTIMES (the workflow's
 * runtime list, JSON) say which runs to expect, and the post names each one
 * whose summary never reached it; without either, nothing can be checked,
 * and the post fails saying so. $FULL is 'true' for a run of every lane, and
 * $RESULT_PUBLISHED and $RESULT_SOURCE are the lane jobs' results: a job
 * that ran a requested lane and didn't end in success turns the post red.
 *
 * It also decides whether the workflow remembers the set as tested, and
 * writes remember=true to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when it does, which asks the
 * workflow to save the set's marker: once a run of every lane had a result
 * from every requested run, a summary passing or failing, and the post
 * went out. A set whose post would only say all is well (every run passed,
 * and nothing else went wrong) is also remembered when its post can't go
 * out until someone acts (there's no webhook, or Discord refused it for a
 * reason the next poll would meet too). A set whose post reports a failure
 * is remembered only once that post goes out, so until then a later poll
 * runs it again and posts it once the webhook works. A post that didn't go
 * out for a passing reason, or a step stopped before the post settled,
 * writes nothing, so a later poll runs the set again and posts. A later
 * poll skips the set only while the cache holds a marker it can read: one
 * a run on the default branch saved, not yet evicted. A forced manual run
 * of a remembered set can't take the marker back.
 *
 * So that a passing failure doesn't cost a rerun of every lane, the post
 * is tried again within the step, three tries in all: after a rate limit,
 * once the wait Discord's answer gives is over (up to five minutes); after
 * a server error, a refusal other than 400, 401, 403, 404 or 413, a
 * request that got no answer, or a rate limit whose answer gives no wait,
 * after a second, then two. Each try waits up to 15 s for an answer
 * ($NOTIFY_TRY_MS sets it), rather than fetch's own five minutes, so a
 * webhook that takes the request and never answers can't hold the step.
 * A request that got no answer may have been taken, so a later try, or a
 * later poll's post, can be a second copy.
 *
 * Without a webhook it prints what it would post. It then exits 0, or 1
 * under GitHub Actions, where an empty webhook means the secret is missing
 * and nobody was told.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/notify.mjs <evidence-dir>
